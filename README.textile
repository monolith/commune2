Everyone with an idea should have the opportunity to let it grow, see where it can take them, and succeed.  People with ideas should not be hindered by lack of contacts or resources.  We all have something to contribute, to take, to give, to be a part of something; an idea... that grows and develops.  We all have a skill to contribute, we all have something to contribute, and in the end our contributions can produce real results, and change the way business is done.

Commune2 is for sharing thoughts and for social networking through collaboration.  It is a platform for people to learn from each other, turn ideas into projects, and turn projects into tangible accomplishments.  We measure our success by the number of good ideas, successful projects, and working relationships created by our members.  We encourage you to open up, think positive, and contribute something to the community.  Do not let ideas die.  Instead, turn them into reality, or let others do it.


* Think open, think often, and share thoughts.
* Help and be helped.
* Do not be paranoid (if it is your idea, you can do it better).
* If you want to do something, do something.


Commune2 is an open source project of the Bison Peak Corporation.
